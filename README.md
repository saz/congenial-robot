# Report microphone state to Home Assistant

Use this script to inform Home Assistant if a capture device is active.

I'm using that to mute my Amazon Echo microphone while on a call.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saz/mic2ha.gitt
cd mic2ha
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

You can use parameters for the script or environment variables.
